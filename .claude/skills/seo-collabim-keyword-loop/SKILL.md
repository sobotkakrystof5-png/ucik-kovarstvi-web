name: seo-collabim-keyword-loop
description: Runs an iterative, human-in-the-loop keyword research process for a website, page by page. Claude proposes a small batch of candidate keywords for one page/section, the user checks real search volume, difficulty and trend in an external SEO tool (Collabim by default; also works with Ahrefs, SEMrush, Marketing Miner, Google Keyword Planner, DataForSEO), reports the numbers back, and Claude picks the best primary + secondary keywords before moving to the next page. Repeats until the whole site has a validated, non-cannibalized, strategically-ordered keyword map. Use when the user wants to go through keyword research together step by step with a live SEO tool rather than dumping a finished keyword list at once — trigger phrases include "let's go through keywords with Collabim", "propose keywords and I'll verify them", "keyword research loop", "ověřovat klíčová slova v Collabim", or "build a site-wide keyword map iteratively".

# SEO Collabim Keyword Loop

A repeatable process for building a validated, site-wide keyword map through a tight feedback loop between Claude and a human who has access to a live SEO keyword tool. Claude never has direct access to real search volume or difficulty data — this skill exists specifically to structure the back-and-forth so that never becomes a problem: Claude proposes, the human verifies, Claude decides, and the result gets recorded before moving on.

The end product is a **keyword-to-page map**: one approved primary keyword + a few secondary keywords per page, ready to drive titles, H1s, meta descriptions, URL slugs and content once the page is written or rebuilt.

## 0. Strategic frame — read this before proposing anything

- **The goal is not "every page has a keyword."** The goal is getting the *whole site* to rank — every per-page decision is judged against that, not in isolation. A locally perfect keyword choice that cannibalizes another page or ignores the site's overall positioning is a bad choice even if it tests well in isolation.
- **Keywords are never picked in a vacuum.** Before proposing anything, pull in the actual context of the project: what the business does, who it serves, where it operates, its tone/positioning, and its current state (brand-new domain with no backlink history behaves very differently from an established site). If the project has its own rules/context docs (a CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, brief, brand doc, existing memory/notes system), read them first and let them constrain the proposals — don't propose something that fits generic SEO theory but ignores what this specific project actually is.
- **Think strategically, not academically.** Prefer what actually works over what is theoretically "correct." For a new or low-authority domain, a realistic long-tail keyword that can actually rank beats a broad, high-volume keyword the site has no realistic shot at. If the tool's data points somewhere unexpected, follow the data over the original hypothesis.
- **Weigh every new pick against the map so far**, not just against the page at hand — that's the only way to catch cannibalization before it's baked into five pages of content.

## 1. Roles

| Who | Does what |
|---|---|
| **Claude** | Proposes 5–8 candidate keywords per page/section, with a one-line reason each. Never invents search volume, difficulty, or trend data. |
| **User** | Enters the candidates into their SEO tool (Collabim or equivalent), reads back volume/difficulty/trend/related terms. |
| **Claude** | Evaluates the real data, picks 1 primary + 2–4 secondary keywords (or asks for another round if nothing fits), checks against the running map for cannibalization, and records the approved row. |

Claude never marks a keyword "final" without tool data behind it. An untested guess does not go into the map.

---

## 2. Before the first round — what Claude needs to know

Gather this before proposing anything; ask rather than guess if it's missing:

1. **What the business actually offers** — services/products, not a guess at what it "probably" does.
2. **Geography**, if it's a local/regional business — exact service area, not "somewhere in that country."
3. **The site's page list** — existing sitemap, planned route structure, or a project doc describing it (AGENTS.md, a brief, a CMS page list). If none exists yet, ask the user for the intended page list before starting.
4. **Known competitors**, if any — helps judge realistic difficulty. If unknown, say so plainly rather than inventing competitors.
5. **Domain authority state** — brand-new domain, low-authority existing domain, or established site with backlink history. This materially changes which keywords are realistic (see section 0).

---

## 3. Page processing order (general heuristic)

Work from commercially critical to least critical — polishing blog topics before the money pages are locked in wastes rounds.

1. Homepage
2. Core service/product pillar pages (the pages that directly drive revenue or leads)
3. Detail subpages nested under those pillars
4. Trust/context pages — About, Testimonials/Reviews, Partners
5. Contact / conversion pages
6. Blog / informational content — lowest priority, handled continuously rather than "closed" like the rest

Adjust this order on the spot if the project's actual structure or business priorities say otherwise — this is a default, not a rule.

---

## 4. The loop — step by step, per page

1. **Claude proposes** 5–8 candidate keywords for the page (mix of core industry term, long-tail phrasing, and a local modifier if relevant), each with a one-line reason tied to that page's search intent.
2. **User checks the tool** — search volume/month, difficulty or competition score, trend direction, and any related-term suggestions the tool surfaces.
3. **User reports the numbers back** — raw numbers, a pasted list, or a screenshot description all work.
4. **Claude evaluates:**
   - Picks **1 primary keyword** — best balance of volume, difficulty, and intent match, weighted for the site's actual authority level (see section 0).
   - Picks **2–4 secondary keywords** for H2s and body copy.
   - Cross-checks the running map for overlap with an already-closed page (cannibalization) — if found, resolve it before moving on rather than leaving two pages competing for the same term.
   - If nothing in the batch is good enough, goes back to step 1 with adjusted candidates instead of forcing a weak pick.
5. **Once approved**, the row gets recorded in the keyword map (section 6) and the page is marked done.
6. **Move to the next page** per the order in section 3.

One round = one page, or a clearly scoped section of a large page (e.g. a homepage hero vs. its later sections can be separate rounds).

## 5. What makes a keyword good

- Matches the page's actual search intent — transactional for service/product pages, informational for blog/guide content.
- Realistic ranking chance given the site's actual authority — long-tail and specific phrasing over broad, high-competition terms on a new or low-authority domain.
- No primary-keyword duplication across pages.
- A local modifier where the business is genuinely local and it fits naturally.
- Reads like something a person would type or a person would write, not a stiff literal translation or keyword-stuffed phrase.
- Prefers what's proven to work over what's theoretically ideal — see section 0.

---

## 6. Where results get stored

- A single running table: `Page | Primary keyword | Secondary keywords | Search volume | Difficulty | Date approved`.
- If the project already has a memory/notes system (a `memory/` folder, a project wiki, a docs convention), put this table there using its existing conventions rather than inventing a new location. Otherwise, default to a dedicated file (e.g. `docs/seo/keywords.md` or `memory/keywords.md`) and say where it went.
- This table becomes the source of truth for on-page implementation — titles, H1s, meta descriptions, URL slugs, content — once the page is actually built or rewritten.
- If the project has its own change-log/memory rules (e.g. a rule that every SEO decision gets logged), follow those rules too — this skill governs the keyword process, not a project's own record-keeping conventions.

---

## 7. Handoff to other SEO work

Once a page (or the whole map) is approved, this is the point to hand off to whatever comes next in that project:

- **Site/URL architecture or cluster planning** — if the project has a keyword-cluster/architecture skill or process, feed it this approved map rather than raw candidate keywords.
- **On-page implementation checklists** — general SEO/content-quality skills or processes for turning approved keywords into actual titles/meta/content.
- **New-domain-specific caution** — if the site is brand-new with no backlink history, keep re-checking picks against that constraint rather than assuming a keyword that "should" work will actually rank soon.

---

## 8. Done condition

The process is done when every page on the agreed page list has an approved primary + secondary keyword set in the map. Blog/informational content is the exception — it keeps getting new entries over time even after the rest of the map is "closed."
